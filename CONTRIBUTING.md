# Contributing

- Use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io).
- Ideally, you provide tests for new features. At least test it manually.
- Provide E2E tests if you developed a whole new user scenario.
- We care about readable code, so try to choose expressive names and try to code clean.
